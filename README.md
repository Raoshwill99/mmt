# Smart Contract-Based Recovery for Missing Memo Transactions

## Overview

This project implements a robust recovery mechanism for blockchain transactions that are missing a memo or tag. It's designed to automatically identify such transactions and trigger an immediate refund or reversal process, ensuring that users don't lose funds due to simple errors.

## Features

- Automatic detection of transactions without a valid memo
- Support for exempting certain wallets from memo requirements
- Configurable minimum memo length
- Placeholder for automated refund process (to be fully implemented)

## Smart Contract Details

The smart contract is written in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. It includes the following main components:

1. **Wallet Management**
   - Add and remove supported wallets that are exempt from memo checks

2. **Memo Validation**
   - Configurable minimum memo length
   - Function to check memo validity

3. **Transaction Processing**
   - Determine if a transaction should proceed or be refunded based on memo and wallet status

4. **Refund Mechanism**
   - Placeholder for the refund process (to be expanded in future iterations)

## Setup and Deployment

(To be added in future iterations)

## Usage

### For Users
(To be expanded in future iterations)

### For Developers
1. Clone the repository
2. (Additional setup steps to be added)

### Key Functions

- `process-transaction`: Main function to handle incoming transactions
- `is-supported-wallet`: Check if a wallet is exempt from memo requirements
- `has-valid-memo`: Validate the memo of a transaction
- `refund-transaction`: Initiate a refund for an invalid transaction (placeholder)

## Future Developments

1. Implement full refund mechanism
2. Add event emission for important contract actions
3. Enhance security measures
4. Implement governance features for parameter updates
5. Integrate with front-end applications for easy user interaction
