# Smart Contract-Based Recovery for Missing Memo Transactions

## Overview

This project implements a robust recovery mechanism for blockchain transactions that are missing a memo or tag. It's designed to automatically identify such transactions and trigger an immediate refund or reversal process, ensuring that users don't lose funds due to simple errors.

## Features

- Automatic detection of transactions without a valid memo
- Support for exempting certain wallets from memo requirements
- Configurable minimum memo length
- Automated refund process for invalid transactions
- Event system for logging important contract actions

## Smart Contract Details

The smart contract is written in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. It includes the following main components:

1. **Wallet Management**
   - Add and remove supported wallets that are exempt from memo checks

2. **Memo Validation**
   - Configurable minimum memo length
   - Function to check memo validity

3. **Transaction Processing**
   - Determine if a transaction should proceed or be refunded based on memo and wallet status
   - Emit events for processed transactions

4. **Refund Mechanism**
   - Initiate refunds for invalid transactions
   - Store pending refunds in contract storage
   - Complete refunds with a separate function call
   - Emit events for refund initiation and completion

5. **Event System**
   - Log important actions within the contract
   - Retrieve event details using event ID

## Setup and Deployment

(To be added in future iterations)

## Usage

### For Users
(To be expanded in future iterations)

### For Developers
1. Clone the repository
2. (Additional setup steps to be added)

### Key Functions

- `process-transaction`: Main function to handle incoming transactions
- `is-supported-wallet`: Check if a wallet is exempt from memo requirements
- `has-valid-memo`: Validate the memo of a transaction
- `initiate-refund`: Start the refund process for an invalid transaction
- `complete-refund`: Finalize a pending refund
- `get-pending-refund`: Retrieve details of a pending refund
- `get-event`: Get details of a logged event

### Events

The contract emits the following events:
- `TRANSACTION_PROCESSED`: When a valid transaction is processed
- `REFUND_INITIATED`: When a refund is initiated for an invalid transaction
- `REFUND_COMPLETED`: When a refund is successfully completed

## Future Developments

1. Implement governance features for parameter updates
2. Enhance security measures
3. Implement a time lock for refunds to prevent potential abuse
4. Add more detailed transaction metadata
5. Integrate with front-end applications for easy user interaction
